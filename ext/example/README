This directory contains a minimal set of files to create dynamic loadable
Gauche extension.   I hope this serves as a template.

configure.in shows how to obtain some parameters consistent to the ones
Gauche has been compiled with.

(1) Finding working gosh and gauche-config

 It is desirable that your extension can be compiled both within the
 Gauche distribution and stand-alone (i.e. adding extension to the
 installed Gauche).   The sample configure.in checks the existence
 of Gauche source, and sets up some parameters like GAUCHE_CONFIG and
 GOSH.

(2) Finding compiler flags

 Do not use AC_PROG_CC.  You have to use the same compiler that
 compiled gosh.  gauche-config script tells you which cc and which
 flags are used.

(3) Installation

 Use gauche-config with appropriate options to obtain default installation
 directories.  There are two categories of those directories, and each
 category has three target directories.

 A category 'sys' is for the extensions which works with main Gauche
 distribution.  A category 'site' is for the ones which are considered
 as auxiliary stuff to fulfill site-specific needs.  The distinction
 is not very strict, though.

 Each category has target directories for header files,
 other architecture-independent files (mostly Scheme files), and
 architecture-dependent files (mostly DSO files).

 It is nice if you give the user a choice to which category he/she
 will install the extension.   Also it's nice that he/she can choose
 it both in configuration time and make time.  The sample configure.in
 and Makefile.in show how to do it.
