;;; This module provides utilities for a common pattern in
;;; filter-type commands, that is, to take an input, to process
;;; the content, and to write the result.   The common occurring
;;; pattern is:
;;; 
;;; - input may be a specified file, or stdin.
;;; - output may be a specified file, or stdout.
;;; - output may be a temporary file, which will be renamed
;;;   upon completion of the processing.
;;; - output file may be removed when an error occurs in the processing.
