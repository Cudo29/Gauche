 *
 * The 'forced' flag indicates one of two state of a promise.
 *
 *  forced == TRUE:  the promise is in 'eager' state.  code has a value.
 *  forced == FALSE: the promise is in 'lazy' state.  code has a thunk.
 *      
 * [syntax]     lazy expr   : Promise a -> Promise a
 *    Creates a lazy promise, delaying evaluation of expr.
 * [procedure]  eager expr  : a -> Promise a
 *    Creates a eager promise, encapsulating the result of evaluation of expr.
 * [syntax]     delay expr  : a -> Promise a
 *    (lazy (eager expr))
 * [procedure]  force expr  : Promise a -> a
 *
 * One might want to create a subtype of promise; for example, srfi-40
 * requires the stream type to be distinct from other types, although
 * it is essentially a promise with a specific usage pattern.  To realize
 * that portably, one need effectively reimplement force/delay mechanism
 * (since 'eager' operation is required to return Stream instread of Promise),
 * which is kind of shame.
 *
 * Gauche experimentally tries to address this problem by allowing the
 * program to add a specific KIND object to a promise instance.
